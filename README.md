### ðŸ“¢ News 

* ***[Aug 2023]***  Two papers accpeted by **CIKM23** as Long Paper, one is **[DiRec](https://github.com/WxxShirley/CIKM2023DiRec)** that introduces a pioneering group recommendation task and an innovative method to address it, the other is **iLoRe** that proposes a new dynamic graph representation learning framework.



### ðŸŒ± Research Interests

My research focuses on **Data Mining**, particularly in the following areas:

* **Graph Representation Larning**: both on static graphs and temporal graphs. 
* **Graph Data Mining**: especially on applying graph-related insights to downstream applications, like Community Detection, Fraud Detection, and etc. The ultimate goal is to empoly machine learning methods to effectively solve real-world applications.
* **Recommender Systems**: espeicially on newly-emerged scenarios, like Group Recommendation and User-centric Group Discovery. As online services evolve, these new recommendation tasks differ from traditional item recommendations. I'm excited about solving these unique challenges to enhance recommender services.


### ðŸ“® Contact 
I am openning to **any kinds of collaborations**. Feel free to drop an email to me:
