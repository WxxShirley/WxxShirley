## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

ðŸŽ“ I am a Ph.D. student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Previously, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Fudan University in 2021 and 2024, respectively.

ðŸŒ± My research interests lie at the intersection of Graph Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, I focus on integrating Graph Learning with LLMs to enhance their reasoning capabilities in graph-related applications, such as task planning for autonomous agents.
